      <h3> Brief Biography</h3>
          <p>
              Old Name: Abdul Kaaba.He was an early convert to Islam and a senior companion (Sahaba)
              of the Prophet Muhammad(saw). Throughout his life, Abu Bakr remained a friend and confidante
              of Muhammad. Upon Muhammad's death he became the first Muslim ruler, regarded as the first of
              the Rashidun (righteously guided Caliphs). His caliphate lasted two years and three months, during
              which time he consolidated the Muslim state. Upon the death of Muhammad, some tribes rebelled, and
              in return he fought the Ridda wars against these Arab tribes to establish Islamic rule over all of
              Arabia. He also conquered the lands of Syria and Iraq.<br><br>

             <nbsp;nbsp;nbsp>  Abu Bakr was the Prophet’s (saas) best friend, and the first rightly-guided Caliph. He was the only
              person, other than the Prophet’s wife (Khadijah), who accepted Islam immediately and believed in 
              Muhammad from Islam’s earliest beginnings. Abu Bakr always remained at the Prophet’s side, and he
              had no reservations about spending his wealth for the sake of Islam and the Muslims. He belonged
              to a wealthy, well-established family in Mecca, but when he died he had only six hundred dirhams.
              He used his status in Mecca to protect new converts to Islam when the Quraish were oppressing 
              Muslims. The Companions recognized his superiority, yet he always remained humble and sincere
              towards all. He is an example of dedication and sacrifice.
